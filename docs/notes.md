# Implementation Notes

## Why masking?

I tried [Genshi](https://genshi.edgewall.org/), [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), and [lxml](https://lxml.de/). All missed in keeping the code unchanged. That's why marking was introduced. The HTML marker just skips HTML-elements and the contents of some special elements.


## Why open source

Because I like open source and have been quite successful doing it.
