degrotesque - a tiny web type setter

The script loads a HTML page - or several in batch, one after the other - and for each, it replaces some commonly used non-typographic characters, such as ", ', -, etc. into their typograhic representant for improving the pages' appearance.  

E.g.:

 "Well - that's not what I had expected."

will become:

 &ldquo;Well &mdash; that's not what I had expected.&rdquo;
